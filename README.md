Currently based on the Menlo font, looking to do something different later.

See [subs.txt](subs.txt) for information on the substitutions.



## Notes

* Not sure what the status of Menlo is wrt. modifications.
* Changes made using the Glyphs app.
* Menlo isn't great wrt. some mathematical symbols such as left, right, top, bottom, etc.
* iTerm doesn't seem to like iota, while other apps do... weird.
* Some multi-character ligatures aren't picked up - example |:"1
